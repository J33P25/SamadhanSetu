# SamadhanSetu

A citizen-focused grievance reporting and resolution web platform developed under the *Digital Dawn* track.

## Problem Statement
In many regions, citizens face significant hurdles in reporting civic problems. Current systems are often complicated, requiring knowledge of which authority is responsible and demanding formal complaint formats that discourage participation.  
 
For individuals with limited literacy or digital awareness, the process becomes even more difficult, leading to underreporting of critical issues. As a result, everyday problems such as potholes, poor waste management, water leakage, and broken infrastructure remain unaddressed. This not only affects the quality of life but also reduces citizensâ€™ trust in governance systems.

## Solution
SamadhanSetu addresses these challenges by offering a streamlined, accessible web platform where grievances can be reported without unnecessary complexity. Citizens can easily submit complaints by attaching photos, selecting categories, and allowing the system to automatically capture their location.  

The platform provides administrators with a centralized dashboard to view, prioritize, and assign complaints. By ensuring that both citizens and officials have clear visibility into the complaint lifecycle, the system builds accountability, reduces delays, and increases trust in local governance.
